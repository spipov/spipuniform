# School Setup Request System - Fixes Summary

## Overview
Fixed critical issues with the school setup request system where OSM localities were not being persisted to the database, causing requests to be stored in-memory and lost on server restart.

---

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. **OSM Locality Persistence**
**Problem**: When users selected localities from OpenStreetMap (OSM), these localities were never saved to the database. The locality IDs were in the format `osm_765382428` which are not UUIDs and couldn't be used as foreign keys.

**Solution**:
- Created `ensureLocalityExists()` helper function that:
  - Detects if a locality ID is an OSM ID (starts with `osm_`)
  - Checks if the locality already exists in the database by OSM ID
  - If not, checks if a locality with the same name exists in the county
  - Creates a new locality record if it doesn't exist
  - Returns the UUID of the locality for use in foreign key relationships

**Code Location**: `src/routes/api/school-setup-requests.ts` lines 30-111

### 2. **School Setup Request Persistence**
**Problem**: School setup requests with OSM localities were stored in an in-memory array (`inMemoryRequests`) which was lost on server restart. Admins couldn't see these requests in the dashboard.

**Solution**:
- Removed ALL in-memory storage fallbacks
- Updated POST method to persist OSM localities before creating the request
- All requests now save to the database using proper Drizzle ORM
- Proper error handling with user-friendly messages

**Files Modified**:
- `src/routes/api/school-setup-requests.ts`:
  - Removed `inMemoryRequests` array (line 11)
  - Updated GET method to only query database (lines 114-140)
  - Updated POST method to persist localities (lines 223-243)
  - Updated POST method to use persisted locality UUID (line 251)
  - Removed in-memory fallback from POST error handling (lines 297-308)
  - Updated PUT method to only query database (lines 355-371)

### 3. **Client-Side Updates**
**Problem**: The school setup request dialog wasn't sending the locality name, which is required to persist OSM localities.

**Solution**:
- Updated `handleSubmitRequest()` to include `localityName` in the request data
- The locality name is extracted from the selected locality data

**File Modified**: `src/components/marketplace/school-setup-request-dialog.tsx` lines 302-312

### 4. **Database Schema Validation**
**Problem**: The `school_setup_requests` table requires `locality_id` to be a UUID, but the API was trying to store OSM IDs directly.

**Solution**:
- Updated the validation schema to accept `localityName` as an optional field
- The API now converts OSM IDs to UUIDs before inserting into the database

**File Modified**: `src/routes/api/school-setup-requests.ts` line 15

## üîß Technical Details

### How OSM Locality Persistence Works

1. **User selects a locality** in the school setup dialog
   - If it's a static locality (already in DB), it has a UUID
   - If it's an OSM locality, it has an ID like `osm_765382428`

2. **Dialog sends request** with:
   ```json
   {
     "countyId": "uuid-of-county",
     "localityId": "osm_765382428",
     "localityName": "Greystones",
     "schoolType": "primary",
     ...
   }
   ```

3. **API processes the request**:
   - Calls `ensureLocalityExists(localityId, localityName, countyId)`
   - Function checks if `localityId` is a UUID or OSM ID
   - If OSM ID:
     - Extracts OSM ID: `765382428`
     - Checks if locality exists by OSM ID
     - If not, checks if locality exists by name in the county
     - If not, creates new locality with OSM ID
   - Returns the UUID of the locality

4. **Request is saved** to database with the locality UUID

### Database Schema

```sql
-- localities table
CREATE TABLE localities (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  county_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES counties(id),
  osm_id TEXT,  -- Stores OSM ID like "765382428"
  centre_lat DECIMAL(10, 6),
  centre_lng DECIMAL(10, 6),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- school_setup_requests table
CREATE TABLE school_setup_requests (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  county_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES counties(id),
  locality_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES localities(id),  -- Now always a UUID
  school_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  selected_school_id UUID,
  custom_school_name TEXT,
  status school_setup_request_status DEFAULT 'pending',
  ...
);
```

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Test OSM Locality Persistence**:
   - Go to `/marketplace/browse`
   - Click "Can't find your school?"
   - Select a county (e.g., Wicklow)
   - Search for a locality that's not in the static list (will come from OSM)
   - Select the OSM locality
   - Complete the school setup request
   - Check database: `SELECT * FROM localities WHERE osm_id IS NOT NULL ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;`
   - Verify the locality was created with the OSM ID

2. **Test Request Persistence**:
   - Submit a school setup request with an OSM locality
   - Check database: `SELECT * FROM school_setup_requests ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;`
   - Verify the request was saved with a proper locality UUID
   - Restart the server: `pnpm dev`
   - Go to admin dashboard: `/dashboard/requests`
   - Verify the request is still visible

3. **Test Duplicate Detection**:
   - Submit another request for the same OSM locality
   - Check database: `SELECT * FROM localities WHERE name = 'YourLocalityName';`
   - Verify only one locality record exists (no duplicates)

### Database Queries for Verification

```sql
-- Check active schools with localities
SELECT s.name, l.name as locality, c.name as county, s.is_active
FROM schools s
LEFT JOIN localities l ON s.locality_id = l.id
LEFT JOIN counties c ON s.county_id = c.id
WHERE s.is_active = true
ORDER BY s.name;

-- Check localities with OSM IDs
SELECT l.name, l.osm_id, c.name as county
FROM localities l
JOIN counties c ON l.county_id = c.id
WHERE l.osm_id IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY l.created_at DESC;

-- Check school setup requests
SELECT 
  sr.id,
  sr.custom_school_name,
  sr.school_type,
  l.name as locality,
  c.name as county,
  sr.status,
  sr.created_at
FROM school_setup_requests sr
JOIN localities l ON sr.locality_id = l.id
JOIN counties c ON sr.county_id = c.id
ORDER BY sr.created_at DESC;
```
