# Admin Schools Management - Fix Applied

## Problem

The admin schools management page was only showing **active schools**, making it impossible to:
1. See inactive schools from the CSV import
2. Activate inactive schools
3. Distinguish between CSV schools and manually created schools

The "Create New School" dialog was for creating brand new schools, not for activating existing ones.

## Solution

### 1. Updated `/api/schools` API ✅

**Added `active` query parameter**:
- `active=true` - Show only active schools (default)
- `active=false` - Show only inactive schools
- `active=all` - Show all schools (active and inactive)

**Added `csvSourceRow` field to response**:
- Shows whether a school was imported from CSV or manually created
- `null` = manually created
- `object` = imported from CSV

**File**: `src/routes/api/schools.ts`

### 2. Updated School Management Table ✅

**Added filter dropdown**:
- "All Schools" - Shows all schools (active and inactive)
- "Active Only" - Shows only active schools
- "Inactive Only" - Shows only inactive schools

**Added Status column**:
- Shows "Active" or "Inactive" badge
- Green badge for active, gray for inactive

**Added CSV indicator**:
- Shows "CSV" badge next to school name if imported from CSV
- Helps distinguish CSV schools from manually created ones

**Updated data fetching**:
- Now fetches schools based on selected filter
- Query key includes filter to properly cache results

**File**: `src/components/school-management-table.tsx`

### 3. Existing Activate/Hide Buttons ✅

The table already had activate/hide buttons that work via PATCH `/api/schools/:id`:
- **Activate button** (green checkmark) - Shows for inactive schools
- **Hide button** (red X) - Shows for active schools
- Both buttons call the existing PATCH endpoint

## How to Use

### Activate Inactive Schools

1. Go to `/dashboard/spipuniform/schools`
2. Select "All Schools" or "Inactive Only" from the filter dropdown
3. Find the school you want to activate
4. Click the green checkmark button (✓) to activate
5. School will now appear in marketplace and be visible to users

### View School Details

- **CSV Badge**: Shows if school was imported from CSV
- **Status Badge**: Shows if school is Active or Inactive
- **Listings**: Number of uniform listings for this school
- **Accounts**: Number of users associated with this school

### Create New School

- Click "Create School" button
- Fill in school details (county, locality, name, level, etc.)
- Choose whether to mark as active immediately
- School will be created as manually added (not from CSV)

## Testing

### Test API

```bash
# Get all schools (active and inactive)
curl -s "http://localhost:3350/api/schools?active=all&limit=10" | jq '.schools[] | {name: .name, isActive: .isActive, csvSourceRow: (.csvSourceRow != null)}'

# Get only inactive schools
curl -s "http://localhost:3350/api/schools?active=false&limit=10" | jq '.schools[] | {name: .name, isActive: .isActive}'

# Get only active schools
curl -s "http://localhost:3350/api/schools?active=true&limit=10" | jq '.schools[] | {name: .name, isActive: .isActive}'
```

### Test UI

1. **View All Schools**:
   - Go to `/dashboard/spipuniform/schools`
   - Select "All Schools" from dropdown
   - Should see both active and inactive schools

2. **Filter Inactive Schools**:
   - Select "Inactive Only" from dropdown
   - Should see only inactive schools (most CSV schools)
   - Each should have a green checkmark button to activate

3. **Activate a School**:
   - Find an inactive school (e.g., "Greystones Community College")
   - Click the green checkmark button
   - Should see success toast
   - School status should change to "Active"
   - School should now appear in marketplace

4. **Hide a School**:
   - Find an active school
   - Click the red X button
   - Should see success toast
   - School status should change to "Inactive"
   - School should disappear from marketplace

## Data State

### Current Schools in Database

**Total Schools**: ~5000+ (from CSV import)
**Active Schools**: ~10-20 (manually activated)
**Inactive Schools**: ~4980+ (waiting to be activated)

### Example: Greystones Schools

```
Primary Schools (7 total):
- Greystones Community NS (ACTIVE) ✓
- SCOIL NAOMH CAOIMHGHIN (inactive, CSV)
- ST LAURENCES N S (inactive, CSV)
- Gaelscoil na gCloch Liath (inactive, CSV)
- St Patrick's National School (inactive, CSV)
- ST BRIGIDS SCHOOL (inactive, CSV)
- ST FRANCIS N S (inactive, CSV)

Secondary Schools (2 total):
- Temple Carrig Secondary School (inactive, CSV)
- Greystones Community College (inactive, CSV)
```

## Workflow for Activating Schools

### Option 1: Admin Manual Activation
1. Admin goes to schools management
2. Filters for inactive schools
3. Reviews school details
4. Clicks activate button
5. School becomes visible in marketplace

### Option 2: School Setup Request (Future)
1. User requests school setup via marketplace
2. Request goes to admin dashboard
3. Admin reviews request
4. Admin activates school from request
5. User is notified

### Option 3: Parent Affiliation (Future)
1. Parent affiliates with inactive school
2. School is automatically activated
3. Parent becomes associated with school

## Files Modified

1. **`src/routes/api/schools.ts`**
   - Added `active` query parameter
   - Added `csvSourceRow` to response
   - Updated filtering logic

2. **`src/components/school-management-table.tsx`**
   - Added `activeFilter` state
   - Added filter dropdown UI
   - Added Status column
   - Added CSV badge indicator
   - Updated query to use filter

## Next Steps

1. **Test the UI** - Verify filter dropdown and activate/hide buttons work
2. **Activate key schools** - Activate popular schools in major cities
3. **Bulk activation** - Consider adding bulk activation feature for admins
4. **School setup requests** - Implement the request approval workflow
5. **Auto-activation** - Consider auto-activating schools when users affiliate

## Benefits

✅ **Admins can now see all schools** (active and inactive)
✅ **Easy activation** - One click to activate any school
✅ **Clear indicators** - CSV badge and status badge show school state
✅ **Flexible filtering** - View all, active only, or inactive only
✅ **Existing functionality preserved** - Create, edit, view still work
✅ **No breaking changes** - Marketplace still only shows active schools

## API Examples

### Get All Schools
```bash
GET /api/schools?active=all
```

### Get Inactive Schools
```bash
GET /api/schools?active=false
```

### Activate a School
```bash
PATCH /api/schools/{schoolId}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "isActive": true
}
```

### Hide a School
```bash
PATCH /api/schools/{schoolId}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "isActive": false
}
```

## Summary

The admin schools management page now provides a complete interface for:
- Viewing all schools (active and inactive)
- Filtering schools by status
- Activating inactive schools with one click
- Distinguishing CSV schools from manually created ones
- Managing school details and status

**The issue is fixed! Admins can now activate schools from the CSV import.**
