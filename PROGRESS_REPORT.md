- ✅ **Data Validation**: Comprehensive error handling and reporting
- ✅ **Development Tools**: Easy-to-use commands for data management

## 📊 Current State

### ✅ What's Working:
- Server runs on port 3350 ✅
- Database with 40+ tables (22 new SpipUniform + 18 existing) ✅
- Authentication system ✅
- Admin user access ✅
- File upload system ✅
- Email template system ✅

### 🔧 What's Built:
- Complete database schema for school uniform marketplace
- User roles: admin, user (ready for family/shop/moderator extensions)
- Comprehensive product attribute system
- Listing and request management structure
- Matching and notification framework
- Geographic data structure for Irish counties/localities

### 📈 Architecture Highlights:
- **API-First Design:** All functionality will be exposed via REST endpoints
- **Mobile-First:** Schema designed for responsive UI components
- **Data-Driven:** No hardcoded categories - everything configurable
- **Scalable:** Proper indexing and foreign keys for performance
- **Type-Safe:** TypeScript throughout with Drizzle ORM

## 🎯 Next Major Milestones

### Phase 2 Goals:
1. Core REST APIs for all entities
2. OSM integration for Irish geographic data
3. CSV school import functionality
4. Basic CRUD operations for products and listings

### Phase 3 Goals:
1. Matching algorithm implementation
2. Notification system 
3. Frontend mobile-first UI components

### Phase 4 Goals:
1. Complete uniform marketplace features
2. Shop management system
3. Moderation tools

## 🔑 Key Decisions Made

1. **Modular Schema:** Split database schema into logical modules following boilerplate pattern
2. **Comprehensive Attributes:** Flexible attribute system for uniform variations (sizes, colors, etc.)
3. **Geographic Structure:** Irish counties → localities → schools hierarchy
4. **Better Auth Integration:** Leveraging existing authentication with role extensions
5. **File System Integration:** Using existing upload/storage system for listing images

## 📝 Notes

- All SpipUniform specific code is clearly separated from boilerplate code
- Schema is production-ready with proper constraints and indexes
- Ready to build API endpoints on top of solid data foundation
- Documentation maintained throughout development process

**Ready for Phase 2 development! 🚀**
