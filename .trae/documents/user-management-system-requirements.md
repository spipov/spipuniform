## 3. Core Process
**Admin Flow:**
Admins log in and access the admin dashboard where they can manage users (create, edit, delete, assign roles), manage roles (create, edit, delete, configure permissions), and monitor system activity. Permission assignment is done through an intuitive checkbox interface.

**User Flow:**
Users log in and are redirected to their personalized dashboard showing only the sections and features their role permits. They can access their profile, view their permissions, and interact with allowed system features.
