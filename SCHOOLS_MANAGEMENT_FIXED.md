# Schools Management - Proper Implementation

## Problem

The user clarified that they **DO NOT** want to see thousands of inactive schools in the main table. Instead:

1. **Main Table**: Should ONLY show **active schools** (clean, manageable list)
2. **Activation Dialog**: Should show a searchable list of **inactive CSV schools** to activate
3. **Creation Dialog**: Should allow creating **brand new schools** manually
4. **Action Buttons**: Need tooltips to explain what they do

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Main Table - Active Schools Only âœ…

**File**: `src/components/school-management-table.tsx`

- Removed the filter dropdown (All/Active/Inactive)
- Table now ONLY fetches and shows active schools
- Query: `GET /api/schools?active=true`
- Clean, manageable list without thousands of inactive schools

### 2. School Activation Dialog âœ…

**File**: `src/components/school-activation-dialog.tsx` (NEW)

**Features**:
- **Search & Filter**:
  - County filter (optional)
  - Locality filter (optional, uses LocalitySearch component)
  - School name search
- **Inactive Schools List**:
  - Shows up to 100 inactive schools
  - CSV badge for schools from CSV import
  - Level badge (primary/secondary/mixed)
  - Location info (locality, county)
- **Selection**:
  - Click to select a school
  - Shows selected school details
  - Activate button to make school active
- **BEM Names**: All interactive elements have `name` attributes

**Usage**:
1. Click "Activate School" button in main table
2. Filter by county/locality or search by name
3. Select a school from the list
4. Click "Activate School" button
5. School becomes active and appears in main table

### 3. School Creation Dialog âœ…

**File**: `src/components/school-creation-dialog.tsx` (EXISTING)

- Unchanged - still allows creating brand new schools
- For schools NOT in the CSV import
- Requires manual entry of all details

### 4. Action Buttons with Tooltips âœ…

**File**: `src/components/school-management-table.tsx`

All action buttons now have tooltips:
- **Hide (X)**: "Hide school from marketplace"
- **View (Eye)**: "View school details"
- **Edit (Pencil)**: "Edit school information"
- **Website (External Link)**: "Visit school website"

All buttons have BEM `name` attributes for testing.

### 5. Two Buttons in Header âœ…

**Main Table Header**:
- **"Activate School"** (Primary button) - Opens activation dialog
- **"Create New"** (Outline button) - Opens creation dialog
